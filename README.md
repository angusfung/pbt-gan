# pbt-gan

PBT is an optimization algorithm that maximizes the performance of a network by optimizating a population of models and their hyperparameters. It determines a schedule of hyperparameter settings using an evolutionary strategy of exploration and exploitation - a much more powerful method than simply using a fixed set of hyperparameters throughout the entire training or using grid-search and hand-tuning, which is time-extensive and difficult.

Implementation of PBT-GAN experiments from [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09846.pdf)
